# food_ordering_website
This project is a food ordering website designed to make the process of ordering food online simple and efficient. Users can browse the menu, add items to their cart, and place orders with ease. Restaurants can manage their menus and customer orders through an admin panel.

The website is built using PHP for back-end logic, HTML and CSS for the front-end, and MySQL for database management. It runs on a local server setup using XAMPP
